			1. By reading "How To Learn CSS" by Rachel Andrew, I learned that in order to deal with CSS, I have to be aware that this is all about boxes. Everything on the screen has boxes that take into account margins, padding, and boundaries; I must know how to handle those boxes.

			2. Before I develop a website using css, I should be aware of how the Internet affects society in the conceptual design stage. According to the second article, unlike expectations that the Internet will "non-materialize" society, the Internet has grown big and fast. "The entire network already consumes 10% of the world's power output, and data traffic is doubling every two years. To offset the negative consequences associated with high energy consumption, renewables were proposed as a means to reduce emissions to the data center." I thought this was a very wise and interesting concept idea for creating a website.

		3. By reading "Accessibility according to actual people with disabilities", I learned that as a designer, I always have to consider that there would be any type of users besides the ones who do not have physical or mental disabilities.

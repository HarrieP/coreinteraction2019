			2. Responsive design refers to a web page approach technique that automatically changes the size of a screen depending on the type of display it connects to, such as a PC, smartphone, tablet PC, etc. Instead of making websites separately for PCs and mobile devices, it can respond to variety of devices by creating a single public website. Because URLs for PCs and URLs for mobile devices are the same, users can efficiently manage access through advertisements, such as search portals. In addition, if the contents of a web page are modified, the same will be reflected in various devices, such as PCs and mobile devices. The core technologies of reactive web are variable grid, flexible images, and media query. The opposite is the adaptive web, which produces separate websites for each device.

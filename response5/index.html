	<h1>Reading #5 - "A Handmade Web" by J.R. Carpenter</h1>

		<h2> Topics/Questions </h2>

		<p>
			1.  How did the online archive frames that contain handmade web pages change? Or how did people start viewing them differently? 

		</p>

		<p>
			2. I agree with the opinion that if a particular object from museum's collection is revitalized to do the present work, it can no longer be a historical object. Instead, it will actively create practical and informative beings. I would like to face this temporal paradox.

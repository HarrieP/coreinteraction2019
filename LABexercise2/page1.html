	<p>African-American fashion designer who came to fame in the fashion houses of Paris, Patrick Kelly was voted into the Chambre Syndicale du Prêt à Porter des Couturiers et des Créateurs de Mode, the prestigious French organization of fashion designers in 1988. He was the first American to be so honored. Although he produced collections only from 1985 until his death from AIDS in 1990 at the age of 35, his exuberant, witty garments proved to be potent and original contributions to the field of fashion. For more biographical information see the Patrick Kelly Archives record. The Patrick Kelly collection of audio-visual recordings documents a selection of the designer's fashion shows, including several of his runway shows from Paris (1986-1989), interviews with the designer on CNN Style (1989) and Runway Club (1989), and a recording of the memorial service held for Patrick Kelly at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.

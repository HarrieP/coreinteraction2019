	<h1>Reading #10 - "Typeface as Programme" - Jürg Lehni</h1>

		<h2> Topics/Questions </h2>

		<p>
			1. I realized only then, when the writer pointed out that only a few people ask questions about the definition and character of digital font in historical discourse of digital font. The phenomenon beyond the boundaries of industrial standards is also rarely questioned.

			2. The writer also talks about copyright issues. Today, digital fonts are legally defined as software, and they are defined as digital fonts of tools. As soon as a user purchases a license, he owns the license within a defined boundary and, therefore, can use the font as a tool as much as he wants, unless he violates the rules of consent. Designers should always be aware of these facts.
